# Connectors Sample

## Prerequisites to Build

1. Install Ubuntu 18+ Operating System. Note that, other Linux based OS types might work but are not tested. 
2. Install the Java Platform 1.8 (JDK)
3. Ensure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your JDK installation
  * Start a bash shell; on Ubuntu, this is the default shell used by the Terminal application
  * Run the command: `env | grep JAVA`
  * You should see a line starting with: `JAVA_HOME`
  * If not, add it to your .bashrc file as follows:
    * edit the .bashrc file: `vi ~/.bashrc`
    * move to the end of the file with the arrow keys and press the "a" key (which puts vi into append mode); start a new line after the comment `# User specific aliases and functions`
    * enter the text: `export JAVA_HOME=`(append with the appropriate path to your java installation)
    * add another line: `export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin`
    * press the `Esc` key, followed by `:wq` (which writes your changes and quits vi)
    * reload the .bashrc file: `source ~/.bashrc`
4. Install Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
5. Add the Maven `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable. See the above example of updating the path by editing the .bashrc file. For example, your .bashrc file might now contain:
  * `export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:/opt/apache-maven-[VERSION]/bin`

## Building the Project

Note: All commands must be run on the solution maven project.

1. Refer connectors/settings.xml
  * `Add your git user name and access token (can be generated at https://github.com/settings/tokens in Personal Access Token section)`
  * `Copy the settings.xml to ~/.m2`
2. Change directory to the solution project:
  * `cd ~/git/addon-app-template/connectors`
3. Clean up all directories:
  * `mvn clean`
4. Compile the projects:
  * `mvn compile`
5. Package the jars according to each individual settings in each module level project:
  * `mvn package`
6. To get the package without running tests:
  * `mvn package -DskipTests`
  
## Box Settings

1. Create a Developer account
2. Create a Box App
3. Generate clientID, clientSecret, public key, private key from the box app settings.
4. Create a webhook for Inbound
